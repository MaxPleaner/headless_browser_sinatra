    It is the default behavior to send the on-click listener (which enables typing text) every time a click
    event occurs.Since websites can clear their DOM event listeners at will, sending the on-click script repeatedly
    ensures that the listeners are active. On certain sites, though, it needs to be send once-and-only-once, and will
    automatically disable re-sending if there is an error. If this happens and then  a completely different website is
    then requested, the on-click listeners will not send and there will be no way to enter text. If this situation occurs
    , click this button.
